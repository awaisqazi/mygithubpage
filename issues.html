            <h2>Building a stronger community:</h2>
            <p>
              NJIT has some room to grow before it becomes the engaging community that we want it to be. As students, we often yearn for something to do on campus when we have free time, but sometimes it is extremely difficult to find something to do that is enjoyable to each of our individual personalities. Everyone has different interests; we need to do our best to cater to all sorts of personalities.

            <p>
              Student Senate recognizes over 60 clubs that are extremely different and engage different types of people, but simple recognition is the extent of our relationship with these clubs. We interact with these clubs once per month at club cabinet meetings, and force executives to attend meetings that could be summarized easily in a simple email. Instead, we could use this meeting time to provide them with leadership seminars and elaborate on how they can maximize the use of the Senate’s resources to create engaging events. A lot of the clubs are not aware that they can be funded on a per-event basis for up to 750 dollars per event. They are not aware that they can use speakers, projectors, microphones, and other equipment that they may need to throw an amazing event for absolutely no cost. Once we train the executive teams on how to become leaders and teach them how to utilize our resources, these clubs will begin to host a more diverse array of events on campus. Soon enough our campus will be filled with an extraordinary amount of events that cater to so many different populations. Instead of having three major clubs - the Student Activities Council, Residence Hall Association, and Student Senate, stressing out over providing events for everyone to enjoy on campus, we can spread that responsibility over the 60 plus clubs at our school. This would engage a larger population and help get people involved on campus.

            <h2>Prioritizing our concerns:</h2>
            <p>
              There is a lot that needs fixing at NJIT. What we need to work on is prioritizing the issues that directly affect the largest populations on campus. For example, our Math Department has an incredibly high failure rate, yet we continue to hire an absurd amount of administrators and an absurdly low amount of new and qualified professors. We spend thousands of dollars on new pool tables and flat screen televisions for the Residence Halls, but have yet to take care of the lack of overhead lighting in Cypress Hall and the always-faulty elevators in most halls. Our campus has an overwhelming majority of commuters, yet we only have one parking deck and five residence halls. We need to make sure we are addressing the concerns of the majority of the student population before expanded our campus and creating new problems.

            <h2>How WE Will Fix This:</h2>
            <p>
              President Rajeet Das set up the stage for the solution; we need to make it clear to the administration that they work for us, and not us for them. We need to mobilize our students and stand up for our right to a quality education and a university whose goal it is to help us. It starts with keeping our students engaged, and we have numerous resources to help us accomplish that. For example the school newspaper, the Vector, is a great resource that we can use to spread information that the administration wants to keep quiet. Recently the administration began discussing the proposed budget for the 2016-2017 School Year. At the meeting where they discussed how to use our money, there was only one student representative. We have every right to see what our university plans to use our money on. A good thing to do would be to circulate red flags in the budget to the student body through the Vector so that our students can voice their concerns. These are the kinds of issues that students can unite behind. As college students we understand the value of our money and we all want to make the most of it. In 2015, we united behind the Highlander to make him the most valuable mascot in our conference. Let’s make 2016 the year that we unite to give the students what they deserve: a quality education and an administration that works with us.

            <h2>Raising awareness of issues:</h2>
            <p>
              NJIT is a diverse campus with so many different fields of study and so many different types of students (Greeks, Athletes, EOP, etc.). Everyone has different issues, and sometimes only people of the same background can truly understand the issues that these students are facing. We need to translate these issues into actionable items that Senate can work to fix.

              We need to work on making Student Senate a better representation of the student body. To do this, we need to restructure the way things work internally. Senators are student leaders; the title gives great power, but also great responsibility. We need to make sure that our Senators are held accountable for the work they contribute. We need to create motivation for them to reach out to other students that they can relate to and get an idea of what sort of issues they would like to see fixed. To do this, we need to make the Senate experience more rewarding. The most rewarding experience is when you find an issue, make it your own, and completely take it down. As president, I would guide Senators through this process and equip them with the tools necessary to face their challenges. I would work on drawing from my experiences in dealing with accomplishing hard to reach goals while also working with the leadership department on campus and other departments that may be able to lend a helping hand. This campaign is all about utilizing the resources we have at our disposal and making the biggest impact that we can make.
