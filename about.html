              My name is Awais Qazi, and I am a Junior at NJIT. My main goal in life is to make as big of an impact as possible. I believe that this goal has spawned from my experiences at NJIT, and for that I am extremely grateful. My involvement on campus started during my freshman year; one night I felt a little bored of my everyday routine of going to class, doing homework, sleeping, and watching Netflix. I decided to try something different and get involved on campus, and I found an opportunity to do so with the Student Activities Council. It started with serving popcorn at their weekly movie nights, and it soon expanded to hosting campus-wide events, and it further progressed to make me the person I am today. The feeling you get when people appreciate the difference you have made is unparalleled and my goal is to continue to serve the student body.
